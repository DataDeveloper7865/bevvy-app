# Quick Start Guide

## ⚠️ Important: Xcode Required

**Xcode is required for iOS development.** If you don't have Xcode installed:

1. Install it from the Mac App Store (free, but ~15GB download)
2. Open Xcode once to accept the license
3. Run: `xcode-select --install` to install command line tools
4. Install CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`

See the main README.md for detailed Xcode installation instructions.

## Initial Setup

Since React Native requires native iOS project files generated by the CLI, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Initialize React Native Project

In a temporary directory, create a new React Native project:

```bash
cd /tmp
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init BevvyTemp
```

Note: If you need TypeScript, you can add it manually after initialization, or the project will prompt you during setup.

### Step 2: Copy Native Files

Copy the iOS native project structure to this project:

```bash
# From the bevvy-app directory
cp -r /tmp/BevvyTemp/ios ./ios
```

### Step 3: Update iOS Project Name

The iOS project will be named "BevvyTemp" - you'll need to rename it to "bevvy-app":

1. Open `ios/BevvyTemp.xcworkspace` in Xcode
2. Select the project in the navigator
3. Change the project name from "BevvyTemp" to "bevvy-app"
4. Update the scheme name
5. Update the Podfile target name to match

Or manually:
- Rename `ios/BevvyTemp.xcodeproj` to `ios/bevvy-app.xcodeproj`
- Update references in the Podfile
- Update `app.json` if needed

### Step 4: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install npm packages
npm install

# Install iOS CocoaPods
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

### Step 5: Run the App

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# In another terminal, run iOS app
npm run ios
```

## Alternative: Use React Native CLI in This Directory

If you prefer, you can initialize directly here (but this will overwrite some files):

```bash
# Backup your source files first!
cp -r src ./src-backup
cp App.tsx ./App.tsx.backup

# Initialize React Native
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init . --skip-install

# Restore your files
cp -r ./src-backup/* ./src/
cp ./App.tsx.backup ./App.tsx

# Install dependencies
npm install
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Metro bundler issues**: Clear cache with `npm start -- --reset-cache`
- **iOS build errors**: Clean build folder in Xcode (Product > Clean Build Folder)
- **Pod install errors**: Delete `ios/Pods` and `ios/Podfile.lock`, then run `pod install` again
